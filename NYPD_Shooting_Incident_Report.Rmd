## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r initial}
library(tidyverse)
#for the heatmap
library(ggplot2)
library(ggmap)
library(RColorBrewer)
if(!file.exists("data")){dir.create("data")}
NYPD_Shooting_Incident_Data__Historic_ <- read.csv("data/NYPD_Shooting_Incident_Data__Historic_.csv")


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r data_cleaning, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r visualization_data}


```


```{r visualization_heatmap}


```
